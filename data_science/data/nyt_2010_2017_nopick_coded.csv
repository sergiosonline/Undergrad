Written and directed by Lynn Hershman Leeson, who guided Ms. Swinton to a more effective performance in the 1998 &quot;Conceiving Ada,&quot; &quot;Teknolust&quot; has a lot on its mind but little on the ball when it comes to transforming thematic notions into dramatic concepts.  The most aggressive of the clones, Ruby, becomes infatuated with an irritatingly incompetent copy shop employee (ok, we got it) played by the perpetually twitchy Jeremy Davies.  Love, it seems, will help her to become real, like some sort of hormonally charged Pinocchio.  There's some potential for entertainment here, but Ms. Leeson's emphatic direction draws much of the fun from the comedy elements.  Even Ms. Swinton, usually the most restrained and elegant of performers, can be found mugging outrageously as she strains to put over the less-than-convulsive laugh lines. &#151; Dave Kehr",2004-02-20,2010-10-26,2017-11-02 4:18,NA,Comedy,Lynn Hershman-Leeson,Lynn Hershman-Leeson,Tilda Swinton,0
